To use the Play CORS module in your application:

1. Configure CORS settings similar to the following in your application.conf file

cors = {
  allow: [ 
    {
      origins: [ "localhost:3000", "127.0.0.1:3000" ],
      resources: [
        {
          resource_pattern: "/file/list_all",
          headers: [ "x-domain-token" ]
        },
        {
          resource_pattern: "file/at/*",
          methods: [ "GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "OPTIONS" ],
          headers: [ "x-domain-token" ],
          expose: [ "some-custom-response-header" ],
          supports_credentials: true,
          max_age: 500
        }
      ]
    }, 
    {
      origins: [ "*" ],
      resources: [
        {
          resource_pattern: "/public/*", 
          headers: [ "any" ],
          methods: [ "GET" ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

2. Add the filter to your Global file in the base package of your application (if you don't already have one, you'll need to create one).

Example:

import com.anypresence.playframework.cors.Cors
import play.api.GlobalSettings
import play.api.mvc.WithFilters

object Global extends WithFilters(Cors.corsFilter)
